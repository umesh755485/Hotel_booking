- Hotel type (city or resort)
- Booking dates
- Length of stay
- Number of guests
- Lead time
- Cancellation status
- Distribution channel

*Note: Due to privacy and data sharing restrictions, the specific source of the online data cannot be explicitly named.*


## Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes the following interactive features:

- **Overall Booking Trends**: Visualizations displaying total bookings over time, allowing for easy identification of peak seasons and slow periods.
- **Booking Distribution by Hotel Type**: Charts illustrating the distribution of bookings between city hotels and resort hotels.
- **Cancellation Rates Analysis**: Insights into cancellation rates, helping to identify potential issues and improve customer retention strategies.
- **Average Length of Stay**: Analysis of the average length of stay, providing insights into customer preferences and revenue potential.

- **Distribution Channel Analysis**: Breakdown of booking distribution across different channels (e.g., online travel agencies, direct bookings), highlighting the most effective channels.
- **Guest Demographics**: Overview of guest demographics, providing insights into the customer base and allowing for targeted marketing efforts.
